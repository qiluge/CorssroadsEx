# CorssroadsEx

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

CorssroadsEx is a new generation of decentralized exchange with trade for same chain, trade for different chain and asset transfer cross different chain

## Features
 1. [Exchange token at same chain](docs/en/exchange%20at%20same%20chain.md):
    CorssroadsEx allow exchange tokens at same chain by smart contract. The exchange include token to token, token to native chain asset. Such as, for ethereum, erc-20 token to other erc-20 token, erc-20 token to ether, and a simle example for exchange ether and erc-20 token is [CrossroadsCoin](https://github.com/etherCrossroads/CrossroadsCoin).
 
 2. Exchange token for different chain:
    You can use some tokens issued at chain A to exchange other tokens at chain B. For example, you can exchange eos and ether at CorssroadsEx.
    
 3. Transfer asset cross different chain:
    Asset transfers is the core feature of CorssroadsEx, it means you can transfer your asset from chain A to chain B and redeem it from chain B at any time. And this transfer process does not affect asset value. With this feature, two or more chain could merge to a new chain or a exist chain that contain all asset of these chain.
